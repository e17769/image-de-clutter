# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Application Bootstrap

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the basic Python project structure with PyQt/PySide,
**so that** I have a working foundation for building the Photo Archivist application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Python project is initialized with proper virtual environment and dependency management
2. PyQt6 or PySide6 is installed and basic window displays successfully
3. Project structure includes separate modules for UI, image processing, and file operations
4. Basic logging configuration is implemented
5. Application can be launched and displays a simple main window
6. Unit testing framework is configured and basic tests pass

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Initialize Python project structure (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Create virtual environment using Python 3.9+
  - [ ] Set up requirements.txt with initial dependencies
  - [ ] Create project directory structure with separate modules
  - [ ] Initialize git repository and .gitignore
- [ ] Task 2: Install and configure GUI framework (AC: 2, 5)
  - [ ] Install PyQt6 or PySide6 for macOS native GUI
  - [ ] Create basic main window class
  - [ ] Implement application entry point
  - [ ] Test basic window display functionality
- [ ] Task 3: Set up logging infrastructure (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Configure Python logging module
  - [ ] Set up log file rotation and formatting
  - [ ] Create logging utilities for different modules
- [ ] Task 4: Configure testing framework (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Install pytest and pytest-qt for GUI testing
  - [ ] Set up test directory structure
  - [ ] Create basic test configuration
  - [ ] Write and run initial smoke tests

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure (Based on PRD Technical Assumptions)
The application should follow a modular design separating concerns:
```
photo_archivist/
├── src/
│   ├── ui/              # User interface components
│   ├── image_processing/ # Image analysis and duplicate detection
│   ├── file_operations/ # File system operations and archiving
│   └── utils/           # Shared utilities and logging
├── tests/               # Test suite
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
└── main.py             # Application entry point
```

### Technology Stack (From PRD)
- **Python Version**: 3.9+ (modern version with good library support)
- **GUI Framework**: PyQt6/PySide6 (for native macOS GUI development)
- **Primary Dependencies**: imagededup library for duplicate detection
- **Threading**: Background processing for UI responsiveness
- **Packaging**: py2app for macOS .app bundle distribution

### Key Dependencies to Include
- PyQt6 or PySide6 (GUI framework)
- imagededup (duplicate detection - will be added in later stories)
- pytest and pytest-qt (testing)
- Standard Python logging module

### macOS Specific Considerations
- Ensure compatibility with macOS Human Interface Guidelines
- Configure for native macOS window behaviors
- Consider macOS security requirements (App Sandbox, code signing)

### Testing Standards
- Use pytest as the testing framework
- pytest-qt for GUI component testing
- Test files should mirror source structure in tests/ directory
- Minimum test coverage for critical paths
- Automated testing for GUI components where possible

### Architecture Notes
**IMPORTANT**: This story is created before architecture documents are available. The Dev Agent should:
1. Follow PRD technical assumptions as guidance
2. Create a foundation that can be refined when architecture is defined
3. Use industry best practices for Python desktop applications
4. Ensure modular design for future extensibility
