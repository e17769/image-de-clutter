- **Duplicate Photos Fixer Pro** ($19.99) - AI-powered similarity detection
- **Gemini 2** ($19.99) - General duplicate finder with photo support
- **Image Capture Plus** - Built-in macOS functionality

**Recommendation**: Add competitive analysis section highlighting:
- **Unique value propositions** vs existing solutions
- **Feature gaps** in current market offerings
- **Pricing strategy** relative to competitors

### 3. Enhanced User Experience Requirements

**Current Gap**: Limited UX specifications for complex workflows
**Industry Best Practices**:

#### A. Onboarding & First-Time User Experience
- **Missing**: Tutorial/walkthrough for first scan
- **Add**: Progressive disclosure of advanced features
- **Add**: Sample data or demo mode for evaluation

#### B. Advanced Preview & Comparison Features
- **Missing**: Side-by-side image comparison with zoom
- **Missing**: Metadata comparison (EXIF, file dates, quality metrics)
- **Missing**: Before/after preview of archival decisions

#### C. Batch Operations & Workflow Efficiency
- **Missing**: Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- **Missing**: Undo/redo functionality for selections
- **Missing**: Save/load selection sessions for large libraries

### 4. Enhanced Technical Requirements

#### A. File Format Support Expansion
**Current**: Limited to .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif
**Industry Standard**: Support for:
- **RAW formats**: .cr2, .nef, .arw, .dng
- **Additional formats**: .tiff, .webp, .heic, .bmp
- **Video duplicates**: .mov, .mp4, .avi (future consideration)

#### B. Advanced Similarity Detection
**Current**: Basic CNN + hash approach
**Industry Leading**: 
- **Perceptual hashing combinations**: pHash, aHash, dHash, wHash
- **Feature-based matching**: SIFT, SURF, ORB descriptors
- **Deep learning models**: Custom-trained CNNs for photo similarity

#### C. Performance & Scalability
**Current**: 10,000 image limit
**Industry Standard**: 100,000+ images with:
- **Incremental scanning**: Only process new/changed files
- **Database caching**: SQLite for scan results persistence
- **Multi-threading**: Parallel processing optimization

### 5. Privacy & Security Requirements

**Missing Critical Requirements**:
- **Local processing only**: No cloud uploads or external services
- **Secure file handling**: Proper permissions and sandboxing
- **Privacy compliance**: GDPR/CCPA considerations for metadata
- **Audit trail**: Logging of file operations for recovery

### 6. Accessibility & Usability Enhancements

**Current Gap**: Basic WCAG AA mention
**Industry Standard Requirements**:
- **VoiceOver integration**: Full screen reader support
- **Keyboard navigation**: Complete keyboard-only operation
- **High contrast mode**: Support for accessibility preferences
- **Customizable UI**: Adjustable thumbnail sizes, font scaling

### 7. Advanced Archive Management

**Current Limitation**: Simple "Archived" folder approach
**Industry Best Practice**:
- **Configurable archive locations**: Multiple archive destinations
- **Archive organization**: Date-based or custom folder structures
- **Archive compression**: Optional ZIP/compression for space saving
- **Archive indexing**: Searchable archive with thumbnails
