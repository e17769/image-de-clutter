# Story 3.1: Thumbnail Display and Image Grouping

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see thumbnail previews of duplicate and similar images grouped together,
**so that** I can visually compare them and decide which ones to keep or archive.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Detected duplicate/similar groups are displayed with thumbnail previews of each image
2. Thumbnails are generated efficiently and cached for performance
3. Images within each group are displayed side-by-side for easy comparison
4. Group headers clearly indicate the type of match (exact duplicate vs similar)
5. Thumbnail size is appropriate for comparison while fitting multiple images on screen
6. Lazy loading is implemented for large result sets to maintain responsiveness
7. Image loading errors are handled gracefully with placeholder thumbnails
8. Groups can be expanded/collapsed for better navigation

  - [ ] Error handling validation

## Dev Notes

### User Experience Requirements (From PRD Analysis)
This story addresses key user persona needs:
- **Sarah (Family)**: Simple visual comparison to identify obvious duplicates
- **Marcus (Professional)**: Quick visual assessment of RAW vs processed versions
- **David (Tech)**: Efficient navigation through large result sets
- **Linda (Librarian)**: Clear visual organization for methodical review

### Thumbnail Generation Strategy
**Performance Requirements**:
- Generate thumbnails for up to 50,000 images efficiently
- Target size: 150x150px for comparison, 300x300px for detail view
- Cache thumbnails to disk for reuse between sessions
- Support progressive JPEG for faster loading

**Technical Implementation**:
- Use PIL/Pillow for efficient image resizing
- Implement thumbnail cache with LRU eviction
- Generate thumbnails in background threads
- Support high-DPI displays (Retina) with 2x thumbnails

### UI Layout and Design (macOS HIG Compliance)
**Group Container Design**:
- Header with group type indicator (exact/similar)
- Similarity score display (0-100% or confidence level)
- Expandable/collapsible group content
- Image count and total file size

**Thumbnail Layout**:
- Side-by-side arrangement within groups
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Hover effects for selection preview
- Loading states and error placeholders

### Lazy Loading Implementation
```python
# Lazy loading strategy
class ThumbnailManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
        self.loading_queue = Queue()
        self.worker_threads = []
    
    def request_thumbnail(self, image_path, size):
        # Check cache first
        # Add to loading queue if not cached
        # Return placeholder while loading
        
    def generate_thumbnail_async(self, image_path, size):
        # Background thumbnail generation
        # Cache result and emit signal for UI update
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Viewport-based loading**: Only generate thumbnails for visible groups
- **Progressive loading**: Load thumbnails as user scrolls
- **Memory management**: Unload thumbnails for off-screen groups
- **Batch processing**: Generate multiple thumbnails in parallel

### Error Handling Strategy
**Common Error Scenarios**:
- Corrupted image files
- Unsupported image formats
- File access permission issues
- Out of memory during thumbnail generation
- Network drive disconnections

**Fallback Mechanisms**:
- Generic file type icons for unsupported formats
- Error placeholder thumbnails
- Retry logic for temporary failures
- Graceful degradation for memory issues

### Caching Strategy
**Thumbnail Cache Design**:
- Persistent cache stored in user data directory
- Cache key based on file path + modification time
- LRU eviction when cache size exceeds limit
- Automatic cleanup of stale cache entries

### Integration with Detection Results
**Data Flow**:
1. Duplicate detection results from Stories 1.4 and 2.1
2. Group results by similarity type and score
3. Generate thumbnails for each image in groups
4. Display in organized, navigable UI

**Group Display Priority**:
1. Exact duplicates (hash-based) - highest priority
2. High similarity (CNN > 90%) - medium-high priority  
3. Medium similarity (CNN 70-90%) - medium priority
4. Low similarity (CNN < 70%) - lowest priority

### Testing Strategy
**Performance Testing**:
- Test with 1,000+ image result sets
- Memory usage validation during thumbnail generation
- UI responsiveness during lazy loading
- Cache performance and hit rates

**Functional Testing**:
- All supported image format thumbnail generation
- Error handling with corrupted files
- Group expand/collapse functionality
- Keyboard navigation testing

**Visual Testing**:
- Thumbnail quality and sizing
- Layout consistency across different screen sizes
- Loading states and error placeholders
- macOS HIG compliance validation
